 APP IDEA
 An app that allows you send  tasks and reminders to others.
 it will be a widget that will be shown on the receivers end. 
 When the mark a task or reminder as complete, the sender receives a notification
 the user will be able to leave messages for the receiver all day. (example. Please remember to take the trash out) 
 since we mostly use our phone, once the user opens his phone he will see the message on the app widget


## Notes

I struggled with navigating xcode but i got a hang of it after a while.
learning swift syntax on the swift playground was interesting
